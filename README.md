## Documentation for Business Card

Languages Utilized: HTML, & CSS.
CSS Grid Generator
Codepen Hover effect over h5 & h6:  https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/poEjvpd 

This is my first live website working with HTML & CSS.

The background patterns for all elements were created in Adobe Illustrator, along with the Liz Trull name graphic.

Difficulties included: aligning icons among the CSS Grid. Example: Email Icon with varying height based on the browser the website is viewed in.

Google Fonts was an important addition to this website to contribute to the overall aesthetic of the static business cards.
